# Awaiting the Halving

Within two days, BTC reward will be halved and reducing the daily supply. Hopefully the demand will be enough to increase the price.

# What is a Bitcoin block halving event?

Block halving events happen every **4 years** or **210,000 blocks** on Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin's initial block reward was **50 BTC**. The current block reward is **6.25 BTC**, the next block reward will be **3.125 BTC**. This lowers the rate at which Bitcoins are generated. The halving is periodical and is programmed into Bitcoin's code.

# What to do?
1. If you have money, buy more BTC.
2. If you don't have money, just wait and watch.

Thank you for reading.
