# Happy Ramadan Mubarak
This site was made with Quartz [^1] as a public digital garden which I hope can be beneficial to humanity.

## How I made this?

Check out [[Youtube - How to publish your notes for free with Quartz]] on how to do this.

## Why it was made?

I used a lot of note/journal app from word processors like Notepad, Microsoft Words to note taking apps like Evernote, OneNote, Day One, Joplin, gitJournal and some I can't remember while typing. In the future I might share my previous experience with those Apps.

This "Digital Garden" was made with Obsidian and Quartz. I am experimenting with the idea of a public information garden where I share information that interest me in public.
